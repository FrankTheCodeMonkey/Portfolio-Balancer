# Portfolio-Balancer

Coming time when you need to max out dem TFSAs and RRSPs, how much do I buy and sell? This handy little calculator tells you how to do that!

**Strongly recommend** the python version instead of Excel, as things break when you move it around. But I've left enough room for you to list 10, 20 stocks already.

You can edit all your parameters in-file on the top (should be trivial what to do) and then just run

```
python rebalance.py
```
